## 🍴 Recipe App

A modern web application for managing recipes, built with PHP and using both MongoDB and MySQL. It allows users to
create, manage, and share their culinary recipes.

## ✨Features

- User registration and authentication
- Create, edit, and delete recipes
- Add images and rich descriptions to recipes
- Comment on recipes and view discussions
- Personal dashboard and profile management
- Search and browse recipes
- Add recipes to your favorites.
- Uses MySQL (PDO) and MongoDB drivers
- Simple, modular MVC-like structure (Controllers, Models, Views)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- PHP 8.1+ (recommended 8.3)
- Composer (dependency management)
- MySQL (via PDO)
- MongoDB (via mongodb/mongodb PHP library)
- Bootstrap (front-end styling and components)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1+ with the following extensions:
    - ext-pdo (for MySQL)
    - ext-mongodb (for MongoDB)
- Composer
- A running MySQL instance and credentials
- A running MongoDB instance and credentials
- A web server (Apache/Nginx) or PHP’s built-in server

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    - git clone https://repo-url/recipe_app.git
    - cd recipe_app

2. Install PHP dependencies:
    - composer install

3. Configure databases:
    - MySQL:
        - Create a database (e.g., recipe_app)
        - Create a MySQL user with permissions for this database
        - If a schema file is provided (e.g., database/schema.sql), import it
    - MongoDB:
        - Ensure a MongoDB database and user are available

4. Configure connection settings:
    - Update your MySQL connection details (host, dbname, user, password) in the MySQL configuration file
    - Update your MongoDB URI and database name in the MongoDB configuration file

5. Configure your web server:
    - Document root should point to the application’s web entry (the Views directory with index.php)
    - For quick local testing, you can use PHP’s built-in server:
        - php -S localhost:8000 -t src/View
        - Then open http://localhost:8000/index.php in your browser

## 🚀 Usage

- Register a new account or log in
- Create new recipes from your dashboard
- View, edit, and delete your recipes
- Browse recipes and leave comments
- Manage your profile information

## ⚙️ Environment & Configuration

- Ensure your PHP environment has both MySQL (PDO) and MongoDB extensions enabled
- Set proper file permissions for any folders that handle uploads (e.g., images)
- Adjust base URLs or paths in configuration or view templates if you deploy under a subdirectory

## 💡 Development Tips

- Follow PSR standards where applicable
- Keep controller logic thin and move data logic to models
- Reuse shared UI components for headers/navbars to ensure consistency
- If you add tests with PHPUnit, place them under a tests directory and configure phpunit.xml accordingly

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

- 500 or blank page:
    - Enable error reporting in your PHP environment during development
    - Verify database credentials and extensions
- Database not reachable:
    - Check that MySQL/MongoDB services are running and accessible
    - Confirm hostnames, ports, and credentials
- CSS/JS not loading:
    - Ensure your document root points to the correct directory
    - Verify relative paths to assets in your layout/templates

## Scripts

- Install dependencies:
    - composer install
- Start local server (example):
    - php -S localhost:8000 -t src/View
